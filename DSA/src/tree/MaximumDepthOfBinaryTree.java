/**
 * LeetCode 104 - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
 * A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path
 * from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 *      3
 *     / \
 *    9  20
 *       / \
 *      15  7
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Pattern Used: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Recursion
 * - Uses recursive DFS to explore each path to its leaf
 * - Bottom-up approach where depth is calculated as we return from recursion
 * - Post-order traversal pattern (process after visiting children)
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes
 * - We must visit each node exactly once
 * - Each node operation is O(1)
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
 * - In worst case (skewed tree), h = n, making it O(n)
 * - In best case (balanced tree), h = log n
 * - Space is used by the recursive call stack

     * - Processes all nodes at current level before moving to next
     *
